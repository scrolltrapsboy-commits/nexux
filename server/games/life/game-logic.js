/**
 * game-logic.js — The Game of Life (server-side, through session 2b).
 *
 * Implements the GameLogic interface defined in server/src/game-logic-interface.js.
 *
 * ─── Sessions ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Session 1: board, spinner, college/career fork, career/salary card draws,
 *   pending-choice state machine, basic pay/collect effect handlers.
 *
 * Session 2a: real implementations of marriage, children (baby and twins),
 *   auto and life insurance, and stocks.  Stock payouts trigger on any
 *   spinner match across ALL players' turns.
 *
 * Session 3 prelude: buy-house mechanic.  sq-m03-buy-home is now a real
 *   house-card draw — player picks one of N offered houses, pays its cost,
 *   gets the value added to final scoring.
 *
 * Session 2b: end-game.  Real retirement-fork handler.  Countryside
 *   Acres and Millionaire Estates as the two terminal retirement tracks.
 *   Retired-but-still-in-game pattern: retired players are skipped in turn
 *   rotation but stay in state until everyone retires.  Life tiles (drawn
 *   at CA retirement, revealed at game over) implemented with hidden
 *   information from non-self viewpoints.  Final scoring formula and the
 *   ME cash-gamble (highest cash among ME retirees wins outright; losing
 *   ME retirees score zero).  pay-tax-by-salary effect type added to wire
 *   up the previously-dead taxDue field on salary cards.
 *
 * Session 3 (deferred): renderer (client/).
 *
 * ─── State shape ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * GameState {
 *   id, name, gameType: 'life', stateVersion, status, config,
 *   players: Player[],
 *   turnState: { currentPlayerIndex: number },
 *   careerDeck: string[],     shuffled remaining career card IDs
 *   careerDiscard: string[],  pile drawn from when the deck empties
 *   salaryDeck: string[],

 *   lifeTileDeck: string[],   (session 2b) shuffled remaining life-tile IDs;
 *                             drawn from at CA retirement.  Late retirees may
 *                             find the deck empty — that's the strategic
 *                             incentive to retire early to CA.

/**
 * Rich action descriptors for the Life renderer. See docs/action-descriptors.md
 * for the contract.
 *
 * Shape choices documented per-phase:
 *   • pending = null, no midTurn — one `spin` descriptor + one descriptor per
 *     out-of-band purchase the player doesn't yet own. Purchase descriptors
 *     carry `enabled` that reflects affordability and `hint` that names the
 *     shortfall amount when disabled. The `buyStock` descriptor's data
 *     carries `takenNumbers` so the renderer's number picker can grey out
 *     numbers other players already own without re-deriving them.
 *   • pending = null, midTurn = true (spin-again chain) — ONLY the `spin`
 *     descriptor. Out-of-band purchases are omitted; matches the server's
 *     own getValidActions rule that midTurn blocks purchases.
 *   • pending.type = 'fork' or 'retirement-fork' — one `chooseBranch`
 *     descriptor per option, with `data.nextSquareId` and `data.squareLabel`.
 *     The two fork types share the same descriptor shape; the renderer reads
 *     player.pending.type to decide whether to apply the retirement-fork
 *     stakes banner.
 *   • pending.type = 'career-draw' / 'salary-draw' / 'house-draw' — one
 *     `chooseCareer` / `chooseSalary` / `chooseHouse` descriptor per offered
 *     card. House descriptors' `enabled` reflects affordability.
 *
 * Already-owned purchases (auto/life insurance, stock) are OMITTED rather
 * than emitted with enabled=false — the renderer rule is "no descriptor
 * means no button," matching the Yahtzee precedent (filled scoreCategory
 * rows are omitted, not disabled).
 *
 * Returns [] for: non-current players, retired players, finished games,
 * pre-initGame waiting-room states.
 *
 * House-draw partial-affordability: when the player can afford SOME but
 * not all offered houses, the unaffordable ones have `enabled: false`
 * with a shortfall hint. The all-unaffordable case is handled upstream
 * in applyBuyHouse, which auto-skips the square before any pending state
 * is set — so no chooseHouse descriptors are emitted in that case.
